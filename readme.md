## General Use

This is the write REST API for our Frontend application.<br>
It takes entities that has to be created or modified in the MSSQL Write-DB.<br>
It is connected to a RabbitMQ queue whenever new entites or changes to existing entities occur, so that the new/updated entities are reflected in the read-only DB<br>.
The repo is divided into folders with the respective responsibilities within the app folder:

- DB: Contains code and connection information for the MSSQL server.
- RabbitMQ: Contains code and connection information for the RabbitMQ.
- Routes: Contains endpoints that the API consists of.
